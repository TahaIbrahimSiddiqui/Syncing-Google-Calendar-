# Google Calendar Auto-Sync

This repository provides a **step-by-step guide** involving zero coding for automatically synchronizing multiple Google calendars into a single unified calendar. Such services are provided by services like [oneCal](https://www.onecal.io/) for money but this is completely **free**!

## Use Case

The primary use case is maintaining calendar availability across different Google accounts. For example:

- You have a doctor's appointment scheduled in your personal Gmail calendar
- This appointment automatically appears as a "busy" block in your work Gmail calendar  
- Your colleagues can see you're unavailable during that time, preventing scheduling conflicts

## What This Solves

- **Cross-account visibility**: Keep personal and professional calendars in sync
- **Prevent double-booking**: Automatic busy blocks across all calendars
- **Privacy protection**: Show availability without revealing appointment details
- **Seamless workflow**: No manual calendar management required

This automation ensures your availability is accurately reflected across all your Google calendar accounts, streamlining scheduling and preventing conflicts.
